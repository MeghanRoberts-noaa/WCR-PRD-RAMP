This repository was created by Meghan Roberts for a project investigating the overlap between fisheries closures and whale presence by fishing zone off the California coast. Fishing opening.rmd makes figures to show when fisheries open and close by zone. These figures also show other types of management actions taken in season. Whale abundance.rmd shows the relative whale presence in each zone over time in the spring months and also when ship strikes have occured.
