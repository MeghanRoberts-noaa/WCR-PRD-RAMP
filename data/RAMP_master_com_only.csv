An attempt was made to tow the carcass to the sea plane base.It failed. A blubber sample was obtained. A larger boat managed to tow the carcass to Polnell Point, NASWI, sea plane base. Necropsy: performed by the additional identifiers above on April 29, 2009. Blubber: dorsal 9.3 cm, lateral 9.1 cm, ventral 9.0 cm. Fluke width 319 cm. Whale measured 41 feet in length. Fair body condition. Moderate decomp. Large amount of blood in body cavity, bruising in some areas of the blubber layer and in some internal organs.Stomach full of recently ingested prey (ghost shrimp). Findings suggestive of blunt force trauma, likely caused by collision with a large ship. Histological testing: Dr. Stephen Raverty. Post mortem decomp and artifactual sloughing of the mucosa from multiple viscera hindered microscopic assessment of the tissues and precluded precise determination of possible antemortem trauma or post mortem putrifaction. In gray whales it is not unusual to observe large quantities of serosanguinous acsites, however, without the presence of blood clots or fibrin deposition along serosal surfaces it is difficult to differentiate frank hemorrhage vs post mortem pooling of fluid within the abdomen. There were no significant lesions within the tissues.The levels of BUN, calcium and phosphorus appear within acceptable limits for a stranded cetacean. PCR of pooled tissues was negative for morbillivirus. No bacteria isolated. The carcass was left at site for cleaning by scavengers. Several weeks later the CPSMMSN collected as many bones as could be found, including the entire skull, mandible and baleen, vertebrae, ribs, scapulae for educational/scientific purposes. Bones collected for educational/scientific use: skull left and right mandibles scapulae 13 ribs right side 12 ribs left side sternum atlas axis 7 cervical vertebrae 27 other vertebrae hyoid arch (3 bones) hip bones (2)",

Based on the necropsy it is very likely that the whale died due to a shipstrike although not quickly. The flesh around injured area from ship strike was necrotic rather than bruised. This may have been because the whale lived through the injury and succombed to secondary bacterial infections from the injury. Stomach was empty. Bones and baleen were collected by Makah tribal members for cultural purposes pursuant to Makah Fisheries Annual Regulation 2014-2. Internal observations were similar to external observation that a large injury occurred to the left side of the dorsal surface of the whale. Tissue around the injury was very necrotic and friable. The rib immediately under where the injury occurred was broken, the ribs adjacent to the broken rib appeared normal. Stomach was mostly empty suggesting that the whale had not recently eaten before it died. Most of the internal organs were too necrotic and decomposed to be of much use for evaluation or histology.

As the vessel turned into Oakland Bar channel, the carcass fell off the bow and sank. The whale was then reported on 1/7/17 floating in Oakland harbor off of Howard Terminal. Two personnel from TMMC went out to assess the animal, take pictures and collect basic samples. Due to the storm with large swells, high winds and rainfall the animal was left floating next to the Howard Terminal. The USCG received a report of the animal floating in the Oakland harbor channel on 1/9/17 causing hazards to passing vessels. The animal was then towed to Angel Island by the Army Corps of Engineers where it was tied off to a pier near Blunt Point until weather conditions improved. Due to repeated intense weather and storm debris clean-up, the Army Corp of Engineers was only able to land the carcass on Angel Island on 1/25/2017.

Crew members believe that the whale must have become stuck after hitting the ship despite saying that they did not feel the impact of any such collision.  Meanwhile, the dead whale was bleeding heavily and had huge gashes and injuries over its huge body, as seen in the video footage.  It is believed that the whale was probably weak when it collided with the ship and ended up being dragged for part of the journey.  Christian Ortega Ortiz, oceanology expert at the University of Colima, told local media: “When the ship was entering the port, the whale was stuck to its bow. Once there, port workers spotted it. It was probably still alive when it first collided with the ship.”  Once in the Port of Manzanillo, crew members and port workers removed the dead blue whale.  Ortega Ortiz said: “In 10 years, this is the first time that a ship has arrived in the Port of Manzanillo with a whale stuck to it like this. We have seen evidence of whales hitting boats, but this is the first of its kind here.”  According to reports, the blue whale’s body was disposed of at open sea.",

Transverse abrasion/laceration across back, starting in L axillae, where it is superficial dorsally and gets deeper about the level of the internal spinous process, extending deep into the epaxial muscle on the L side at least 11cm. Oblong and oval abrasion with irregular margins on the lateral aspect of the L fin that extends into the dermis. It is deepest proximal to body and more superficial distally.
